# PRAS WINDOWS APPLICATION

On June 15, 2024, an easy-to-use Windows Desktop Application version of the PRAS server was developed. The download link for the EXE file is available through the website https://www.protein-science.com/

While the web application interface performs only the tasks described in the PRAS paper, the desktop counterpart, which I built in 2024 has extended features. The extended features include tools to build model structures (such as constructing a model of a protein in a pure solvent or mixed solvent, generating pure or mixed solutions, etc.), tools to build crystalline nanostructures (spherical or cylindrical silica nanoparticles) and tools to perform Brownian Dynamics (BD) Simulations of colloidal gels.

# INSTALLATION

The program has been tested on Windows 10 and 11 64-bit operating systems. The program follows a standard Windows installation process. To install the software, double-click the installation file. A shortcut is automatically created on the desktop upon completion. To uninstall the software, navigate to Control Panel -> Programs and Features, then double-click to uninstall.
